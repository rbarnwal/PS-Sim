The datastructure is as follows:
EventNo: The event-id of the Traffic event	
Date	: The date when the traffic event occurred
Day	: The day when the traffic event occurred
Time	: The time when the traffic event occurred
ReportNo	: The report number as registered at the participatory sensing server
Source	: The participant's unique identification number
ParticipantRank	: The reputation/rank of the reporting participant
ReportReliability	: The system generated reliability score of the submitted event report
EventReported	: The traffic event report which is reported by the participant
EventOccured : The traffic event which has already been occurred
